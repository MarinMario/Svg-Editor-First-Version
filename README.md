# Svg Editor
 A Svg Editor made in Elm.
 
This is my first try of making a svg editor in elm and more than that it's my first try making an actual web dev project so you might not want to continue furher. However, if you are brave enough, go ahead. If you want to check out the second version you can find it here: https://github.com/maoitsme/svg-editor-2 This one is a lot better.
